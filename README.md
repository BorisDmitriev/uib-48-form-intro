## Exercise: Form 1

**Instructions**:
1. Create a form wherein a user can input their details and choose their respective skills. See the image for the input fields, skills and design of the form.
2. Your form should be split into two parts:
    - The first part should be the form for the user to input their details.
    - The second part should be for the user to choose their skills.
3. Each section should contain a `legend` tag with the appropriate title.
4. Make sure all your `input` and `label` fields have their `type` and `for` attributes defined respectively.
5. Your form must use a `textarea` field for comments.
6. `category` in the form should be a dropdown menu.
7. Use `radio` buttons and `checkboxes` where appropriate.
8. Use the mockup provided and create a form that meets the requirements above üòâ .
